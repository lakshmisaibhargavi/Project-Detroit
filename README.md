**Project Detroit  means fair and justice in the French language. As the name suggests it is a project designed to maintain transparency and fairness in the lawsuits which are filed by different individuals. We used blockchain to solve some of the major problems reported by citizens across the country like data tampering and corruption.**


## Inspiration
It was an incident that inspired us to come up with an idea like this. There is an old couple in our relatives who had suffered a lot from filing a case 
against the son of a politician. The son of a politician made an accident which resulted in severe injuries of a person walking on the road. He is the son of                    the couple that I mentioned before. The politician's son was drunk when drove the car. The couple filed a lawsuit against the politician son in which they                        lost. They were so sad that justice is not possible in India. While listening to this  I had a thought of "Is it the situation of thousands of cases filed                        daily in our country?".Adding to that, there is around 45 lakh pending cases in just the high courts of the country. We need a transparent way to track and                      store all the data. When a case is filed in a police station, all the involved people will not get the status of the case and in which stage the case is. In                      ndia different types of cases of different steps. And each step has different procedures that are important for the people involved to understand. There is                      not a perfect way to do that. Some cases are transferred from one court to another.There is not a transparent way to do that. There were many cases in which                      the cases have been manipulated to give false hearings by changing the data and proofs. There were many cases that a corrupted official tampered the data                        which resulted in injustice to the right people. As a solution for all these problems and many more we use **blockchain technology** as a transparent                            solution.The name of this project **Project Detroit **
      

## What it does
We used blockchain technology to create an application that can be used by both citizens and officials. All the data entered from the beginning of a lawsuit                     to the ending of the lawsuit is stored and maintained using blockchain technology. There will be two interfaces. One is the citizen interface and another is                     the official's interface. A person or a group of people can file a lawsuit in the police station or the court directly depending on the case. The officials                       will file the lawsuit and upload all the information given by the citizens and generate a unique identification token based on the date, time, and location                       for that particular lawsuit.The person can use this token to know the status of the lawsuit he/she filed. Along the time when the case goes through different                     steps, each step and procedure will be uploaded. The person who filed the lawsuit can track the status of the lawsuit using the token. We use blockchain to                       store the data. Through this, the data is more secure and robust. The data cannot be manipulated and there is no chance of tampering. We can also reduce the                     usage of paper which helps the environment. Data monitoring becomes as easy as it's digital. If a change has to be done in the data only authorized personnel                     can do that with a proper explanation.



## How is it differnt from before solutions:
Nowadays lawsuits that are filed in police stations and courts are digitalized, but not completely. They don't upload all the                                                     information regarding the lawsuit and data can be manipulated easily. With our project, we are solving this problem using                                                         blockchain technology. We can also reduce the corruption in the department of law and order. In India, it's an open truth that                                                   due to corruption many lives were lost, and injustice happened to many people. This project can help with all of these issues.



## How it does these things:

This is a mobile-based application on the citizen's side and a web interface for the officials. Once a person wants to file a lawsuit he can go to either court or police station depending on the type of lawsuit or case he/she has to file. Once the required details are provided a unique identification token will be generated based on the time, date, and location. The data entry work is done by either the policemen or the court officials/lawyers. Once the lawsuit is registered the data will be updated from time to time (data means the steps and procedures, hearings for the lawsuit within the police station, or the courts).On the user end i.e the citizens can use a mobile application that requires the unique token to see what's happening. Once the unique identification token number entered, then he/she will be able to see the progress happening in the lawsuit. Everyone involved in that lawsuit can have the same token so that they all can see the progress that is taking place. Once the lawsuit is solved then it can be closed by the officials but still, then the token will be active for future reference.

- You may think that this project is against privacy rules. But we considered privacy and created different filters like public, private, and minor. Public cases are filed to solve a public problem that can be tracked by anyone. Private and minor cases can only be tracked by some of the people and some of the officials. The accessibility authorization is given by court officials based on the type of lawsuit filed.


## Challenges we ran into: 

- One of the challenges we ran into was token generation.Because we arenot generating randomized tokens.The token generated are based on the date,time and the location.Almost every part of the country comes under the range of any oone policestation.Based on this we generate tokens.

- Another challenge we faced was integrating an application with blockchain.Its a complex netwrok and the two interfaces has to be differentiated.


## What's next:

- We are planning to add features to track all the locations of the involved people who installs the the mobile application.
